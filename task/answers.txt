The resulting p-value for testing the non-correlation indicates that there is
a weak correlation. And the IGL mean surface brightness can be higher when
galaxies are further from each other. This is because regions where galaxies
are more widely spaced have less light pollution from stars and other
luminous objects, which can make the IGL more visible. 

However, it is important to note that the relationship between IGL surface
brightness and distance between galaxies is complex and may depend on other
factors such as the presence of dark matter and the specific properties of
galaxies and their environments.
