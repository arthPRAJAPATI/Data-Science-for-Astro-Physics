1. Each sample is drawn from a normally distributed population since the p-values
are greater than 5%, and we fail to reject the null hypothesis.

2. A high result indicates that given input samples are from populations with
equal variances.

3. Since the p-value is greater than the commonly used significance level of
0.05, we accept the null hypothesis that both groups are drawn from the
populations with the same IGL mean surface brightness. This means that there
is not enough evidence to suggest that the means of the groups are different.
Therefore, we can't say that LSB features have a significant influence on
the IGL mean surface brightness.

But we can still see a difference between the mean `mean_mu` values. LSB
features can affect the IGL mean surface brightness in several ways. For
example, LSB features can be sources of diffuse gas and stars that have been
stripped from galaxies, which can then contribute to the overall IGL signal.
Additionally, LSB features can be sources of scattered light that can
contribute to the overall surface brightness of the group.
