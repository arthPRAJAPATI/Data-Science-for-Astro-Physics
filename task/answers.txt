We can see correlation:
1. Lower value of mean Sersic index corresponds to higher IGL mean surface
brightness. 
2. Higher value of mean numerical Hubble stage corresponds to higher IGL mean
surface brightness. 

However, it is important to note that the relationship between IGL and mean
Sersic index or Hubble stages can be complex and may vary depending on the
specific group of galaxies being studied.
